        <summary>Fixing bad programming (11/24/2025)</summary>
        <p>This website has Awful programming, like <strong>awful</strong> <em>programming</em>. I want to fix that
            sometime :/</p>
        <p>This website has a bit of awful progremming in multiple diffrent places, for example the css is all over the
            place and there are many useless things in the code. For example I put the css of this site in the loading
            of my blog. <br>
        <pre>
    &lt;div = "blogframe"&gt;
    &lt;style&gt;
        a {
            color: blue;
        }

        @media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {
            a {
                color: yellow
            }
        }
    &lt;/style&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
</pre> Like what? This is awful, its loaded IN to the site, not from the static original site, this is so annoying for many reasons. I'm going to fix this, expect an update for this website soon :)))

        <summary>Google Snake (11/23/2025)</summary>
        <p>Google snake. Im sure you heard of it before, its that cute little game that exists if you search up “sanke”
            on the google engine, if you have NOT seen it, I actually have it <a
                href="https://www.google.com/fbx?fbx=snake_arcade"> right here</a> for you to view :D.
            <br>
            Anyways, today i descivored that theres a whole community behind the snake game, and I’mm quite shocked on
            the things the’ve done. Its amazing how they managed to beat the game on nearly all the modes, And thats
            really cool. Anyways, thanks for reading.

        <summary>The nintendo DS (11/22/2025)</summary>
        <p>The Nintendo DS is surprisingly powerful, with the ability to render 2048 triangles at once. And considering
            this was released at a time when 3Dgraphics were still quite basic, putting them all into one convenient
            nice little handheld was the thing that sent 3D graphics from basic to amazing.</p>
