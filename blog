    <summary>Programming in-person (11/27/2025)</summary>
    <p>Programming today is a very different experience to the original programming experience, at least in my opinion. For one, programming has simply become a <em>asking game</em> and not about anything related to the true spirit of programming. <br> <img style="width: 200px;" src="https://www.daskeyboard.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/code-1076536_960_720.jpg"> <br>Programming has simply become a game of asking and mindless copying and following, without the context of understanding or the joy of figuring out a complex problem or issue. This is truly devastating and sad, which further increments the true death of prosamming in favour of copying and asking people for help, the devastating truth of programming nowadays. Teaching children programming should not be about teaching them concepts or facilitating the program, instead it should prioritize puzzle solving and critical thinking skills. This approach to teaching programming does not work and simply results in children asking or <em>begging</em> teachers or guardians on programming. If this continues, programming will not be a fun or interesting puzzle solving task, and will simply become one of the many things that <strong>artificial intelligence</strong> will copy.</p>

<summary>New super mario brothers. Wii (11/26/2025)</summary>
<p>New super mario brothers Wii is a video game that has amassed the msot sales over the entire new. series. Selling around 12 million copies. Due to the immense popularity, the game obsivly had some kind of key sucess factor. I think that the sucess factor of the game was its multiplayer. Multiplayer heavily improveed the original game, as the game was finally enjoyable by diffrent types of people.</p>
<img  width="200px" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f3/New_Super_Mario_Bros._Wii_logo.svg"> <img width="200px" src="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/super_mario_wii_2_ars.jpg"> 
<p>The immense opoularity of the game was also becuase of the Wii's sucess, and the huge marketing it recieved.</p>
<em>Does it deserve all its fame? And is it a good game in general?</em>
<p>In my opinion yes, as its fame is derserved. Ignoring marketing campaign's and the Wii's succsess, it is a great game. <br>It is in its core, an extremely good game, containing amazing and unique levels, such as the jumbo one. The level contains flying jumbo rays flying around, and jumping on one another is extrmeely fun and unqiue, among other examples. In conclusion, the game is extrmely fun and I think it is worth a try :)</p>

        <summary>Fixing bad programming (11/24/2025)</summary>
        <p>This website has Awful programming, like <strong>awful</strong> <em>programming</em>. I want to fix that
            sometime :/</p>
        <p>This website has a bit of awful progremming in multiple diffrent places, for example the css is all over the
            place and there are many useless things in the code. For example I put the css of this site in the loading
            of my blog. <br>
        <pre>
    &lt;div = "blogframe"&gt;
    &lt;style&gt;
        a {
            color: blue;
        }

        @media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {
            a {
                color: yellow
            }
        }
    &lt;/style&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
</pre> Like what? This is awful, its loaded IN to the site, not from the static original site, this is so annoying for many reasons. I'm going to fix this, expect an update for this website soon :)))

        <summary>The nintendo DS (11/22/2025)</summary>
        <p>The Nintendo DS is surprisingly powerful, with the ability to render 2048 triangles at once. And considering
            this was released at a time when 3Dgraphics were still quite basic, putting them all into one convenient
            nice little handheld was the thing that sent 3D graphics from basic to amazing.</p>
