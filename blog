<summary>Its been a while (Super Paper Mario) (2/4/26)</summary>
<p>It has been  a while since I've actually posted here, but for the zero people who read this blog welcome back :)</p>
<p>I've been gone a while simply because I procastinate a lot and spend a l ot of time not doing thing sproductivily, anyways, now I'm back, I'll try to post more things :)</p>
<p >Super Paper Mario:

Super Paper Mario is one of the most loved and interesting games from Nintendo; it focuses on different dimensions, primarily flipping between the 3rd and 2nd dimensions. The game’s unique mechanics make the game so much more interesting and intriguing than (in my opinion) The Thousand-Year Door.

In this part, I will discuss the general plot of Super Paper Mario, level by level.
<br>

<em><h3>Plot!!!</h3></em> 

The game starts off with Princess Peach being kidnapped, and Mario and Luigi (obviously) need to save her. However, after breaking into Bowser’s Castle, they realise that Bowser did NOT kidnap Peach, and it was actually the result of another villain, known as Count Bleck. Count Bleck then kidnapped Peach and sucked everyone but Mario into some sort of black hole.
Mario then wakes up and meets with the game’s main partner, Tippi. And after travelling to Flipside, we meet Merlin, who tells us about the 7 pure hearts, which could stop the world from ending. (This is simplified a lot).
<br><br>
<strong>World 1</strong>
<br><br>
After Mario accepts the mission and returns the first pure heart. Mario travels to the first world, 1-1. In 1-1, the game introduces its new turn-based combat system, and everything is being done on one screen. Mario then grants the ability to flip into the third dimension. 
<br><br>

In 1-2, Yold Town, we meet one of the many Pixls. The Pixls are (sort of) like partners in the game, and we first meet one named Throu. Thoreau has the ability to throw things by grabbing them with the 1 button. After this, you cross a few free bridges, and the level ends.
<br><br>
In 1-3, Mario meets Oh Chunks. O chunks in fact is one of Super Paper Mario's Main characters, or villians to be clear, he is used a lot in the game, but he is fun with his... scottish accent???
<br><br>
In 1-4, Mario meets Fragtail.  Where we are forced to fight him, the boss fight revolves around you having to jump on his back and attack him with enemies on his back. There's actually a cool trick where you can jump on his back again and deal infinite damage.

    <summary>Animal Crossing City Folk (12/3/25)</summary>
    <p>Animal Crossing City Folk is a fun game released in 2009 for the Nintendo Wii. The game is famous for being very similar to <a>Animal Crossing Wild World</a>, but I think it's not; it displays so many fun and interesting qualities that it's hard to ignore.</p>
    <em><strong>A run-down of the game</strong></em>
    <br><br>
    <img src="https://dodo.ac/np/images/thumb/0/0e/CF_Rover_Bus.png/300px-CF_Rover_Bus.png">
    <p>The game starts you off with Rover, who asks a lot of questions about you, such as your name, age, birthday, etc. This is a clever way to ask the player about things without making a boring menu screen, and I think it adds so much more charm to the game.</p>
    <p>We meet <a href="https://nookipedia.com/wiki/Tom_Nook">Tom Nook</a>, who does a lot of things, like giving you your house (and your debt, grrr...), explaining the store, and helping you meet and socialize with villagers. This serves as the "tutorial" of the game and helps new players understand its core, even if they've never touched a video game before.</p>
    <p>After this, the game lets you do <em>whatever</em> you want. Planting flowers, talking to villagers, upgrading Tom Nook's store, or visiting the city.</p>
    <em><strong>The city</strong></em>
    <img src="https://dodo.ac/np/images/thumb/3/38/CF_City.jpg/600px-CF_City.jpg">
    <p>The game is called City Folk, so you would think that the city plays a huge role in the game. The truth is, it does not; at least it doesn't force you to play it.</p>
    <p>The game has a whole city section, featuring <em>GracieGrace</em> for hair and beauty, <em>Crazy Redd's</em> for paintings, and many <a href="https://nookipedia.com/wiki/City">more</a>. The thing that makes the city section interesting is that it does not force or require you to go to the city; it is simply there for you. In fact, when I first played this game, I had no idea that this even existed! :)</p>
    <em><strong>Conclusion and Judgment</strong></em>
    <p>Animal Crossing City Folk is an amazing game, featuring amazing villagers, locations, and people. The game truly is something I will always have in my heart, and compared to <a href="http://mariowiki.com/New_Super_Mario_Bros._Wii">New Super Mario Bros</a>, I do have more attachment to this game and proper memories associated with it (sorry, New Super Mario Bros Wii :/)</p>
    <p>I highly recommend you play it and try it out, as I think it compares to <a href="https://nookipedia.com/wiki/Animal_Crossing:_New_Horizons">Animal Crossing New Horizons</a> as a game.</p>
    <em><strong>Yes, sorry for my upload schedule</strong></em>
    <p>I've been lazy lately, and the excuse from last post was simply because I was tired and had no motivation (sorry lol).</p>
    <p>All jokes aside, I am working on something—not toooo big, but hopefully a good startup or something like that. I hope this long post will make up for the two days without posting.</p>

<summary>XOR textures are cool (11/30/25)</summary>
<p>The xor texture is a really cool texture that takes minimal effort to make, infact, you can even fit it into 128 bytes. Heres a quick demo of what an xor texture looks like:</p>
    <img src="https://lodev.org/cgtutor/images/xortexture.gif">
        <p>Its just a cool default texture, you can read about it in this <a href="https://lodev.org/cgtutor/xortexture.html">cool article</a> i found :)</p>

        <summary>CSS wastes a lot of space, The 1kb club (11/29/25)</summary>
        <br>
        <em>CSS wastes a lot of space</em>
        <p>CSS is  a prgramming laguage, and nonetheless, is VERY wasteful on space, it takes up loads of bytes to load somthyhing, for example, centering a div takes this:
        </p>
        <pre>
            #idk {
                position: absolute;
                left: 50%;
                top: 50%;
                transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
            }
        </pre>
        <p>Wow, thats innecficent, now sure it is readable, but honselty, css should be more effecine tas a languge, as trying to programming with low amounts of data with CSS is simply a impossible thing to do. </p>
        <em>The 1kb club</em><br>
        <strong>I kinda want to do 2 mini articles, so this is what I'm going to do.</strong>
        <p>The 1kb club tests the ABSOLUTE limits of storing data with HTML, the link to it is <a href="https://1kb.club">this</a></p>
        <p>As the name suggests, you need to create a webpage in 1 kilobyte of space, 1000 bytes, or 1000 8 bit characters. This restriction is extrmely hard to program in, as mentioned in the top, css and html tags really limit how much data you can put in. The 1kb club is a really cool website, and you should probaly check it out, along with the <a href="https://1mb.club/">1mb club</a> and the <a href="https://250kb.club/">256kb club</a>.<br>

        <summary>Programming in-person (11/27/2025)</summary>
        <p>Programming today is a very different experience to the original programming experience, at least in my
            opinion. For one, programming has simply become a <em>asking game</em> and not about anything related to the
            true spirit of programming. <br> <img style="width: 200px;"
                src="https://www.daskeyboard.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/code-1076536_960_720.jpg"> <br>Programming has
            simply become a game of asking and mindless copying and following, without the context of understanding or
            the joy of figuring out a complex problem or issue. This is truly devastating and sad, which further
            increments the true death of prosamming in favour of copying and asking people for help, the devastating
            truth of programming nowadays. Teaching children programming should not be about teaching them concepts or
            facilitating the program, instead it should prioritize puzzle solving and critical thinking skills. This
            approach to teaching programming does not work and simply results in children asking or <em>begging</em>
            teachers or guardians on programming. If this continues, programming will not be a fun or interesting puzzle
            solving task, and will simply become one of the many things that <strong>artificial intelligence</strong>
            will copy.</p>

        <summary>New super mario brothers. Wii (11/26/2025)</summary>
        <p>New super mario brothers Wii is a video game that has amassed the msot sales over the entire new. series.
            Selling around 12 million copies. Due to the immense popularity, the game obsivly had some kind of key
            sucess factor. I think that the sucess factor of the game was its multiplayer. Multiplayer heavily improveed
            the original game, as the game was finally enjoyable by diffrent types of people.</p>
        <img width="200px" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f3/New_Super_Mario_Bros._Wii_logo.svg">
        <img width="200px" src="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/super_mario_wii_2_ars.jpg">
        <p>The immense opoularity of the game was also becuase of the Wii's sucess, and the huge marketing it recieved.
        </p>
        <em>Does it deserve all its fame? And is it a good game in general?</em>
        <p>In my opinion yes, as its fame is derserved. Ignoring marketing campaign's and the Wii's succsess, it is a
            great game. <br>It is in its core, an extremely good game, containing amazing and unique levels, such as the
            jumbo one. The level contains flying jumbo rays flying around, and jumping on one another is extrmeely fun
            and unqiue, among other examples. In conclusion, the game is extrmely fun and I think it is worth a try :)

        <p>The Nintendo DS is surprisingly powerful, with the ability to render 2048 triangles at once. And considering
            this was released at a time when 3Dgraphics were still quite basic, putting them all into one convenient
            nice little handheld was the thing that sent 3D graphics from basic to amazing.</p>
