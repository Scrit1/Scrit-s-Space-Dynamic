<h2>The nintendo DS (11/22/2025)</h2>
<p>The Nintendo DS is surprisingly powerful, with the ability to render 2048 triangles at once. And considering this was released at a time when 3Dgraphics were still quite basic, putting them all into one convenient nice little handheld was the thing that sent 3D graphics from basic to amazing.</p>
